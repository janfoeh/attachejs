attachejs
=========

Attaché is a JS library for tooltips and palette UI elements. Its goal is to provide a solid foundation that is easily adapted to your specific requirements; 
it is not meant to be one of the many [full-featured drop-in libraries](http://www.unheap.com/section/user-interface/tool-tips/) out there.

Instead, the project is focused on being compact, easily understandable and extendable, fast and well-tested.

**Please note that this project is still a very early work in progress. It is not yet meant for public consumption.**

Usage
-----

Include the base script:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="attache.js"></script>

If you wish to use Attaché as a jQuery plugin, include the adapter as well:
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="attache-jquery.js"></script>

Include the limited base styles, or copy them into your own stylesheets:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="attache.css">

See the [class documentation](doc/Attache.html) for options and examples.
