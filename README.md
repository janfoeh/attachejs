attachejs
=========

Attach√© is a JS library for tooltips and palette UI elements. Its goal is to provide a solid foundation that is easily adapted to your specific requirements; 
it is not meant to be one of the many [full-featured drop-in libraries](http://www.unheap.com/section/user-interface/tool-tips/) out there.

Instead, the project is focused on being compact, easily understandable and extendable, fast and well-tested.

Please note
===========

This project is still a very early work in progress. It is not meant for public consumption yet.
